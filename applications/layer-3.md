# Summary
[summary]: #summary

Layer 3 Blockchain understands the importance of a strong LoRaWAN network to power a decentralized IOT revolution. Helium is a leader in this regard with 23,210 HotSpots worldwide and 1 GB of LongFi data produced in the last 30 days at time of writing. We seek to leverage our years of experience in the blockchain industry and use our large network of innovators and investors to grow Heliumâ€™s Proof of Coverage by allowing us to take on the manufacturing component to drastically increase order fulfilment time.

# Motivation
[motivation]: #motivation

We have been propelling the adoption of Helium miners in the United States using current vendors. In order to build the supply of miners and meet the booming demand, we have sourced U.S. manufacturers to create and assemble the miners allowing us to sell directly to consumers. These companies are located in Texas, North Carolina, and California for assembly and sourcing of additional parts.

# Company Information
[stakeholders]: #stakeholders

Layer 3 Technology, LLC is a Raleigh, North Carolina based company (Company Website: [l3blockchain.com](http://l3blockchain.com)). We have the only public location in Raleigh and are fostering a strong crypto community in this booming city. Anyone can attend our regular meetups & events or take one of our educational courses. We provide the city of Raleigh personalized crypto-support and offer blockchain project incubation or consultation services. A store-front gives instant access to high demand crypto-equipment such as the helium miner.

# Product Information

The specifications are as follows:

-   Raspberry Pi 3B+ (or newer)
    
-   Pi Hat for IOT Devices
    
-   DC power supply (5v)
    
-   SEMTEC SX-1302 (or compatible) Concentrator Module
    
-   10 Mounting Screws
    
-   Injection Molded or 3D printed outer-casing (high-quality filament)
    
-   Antenna (~915 MHz)

# Customer Support

We will provide a support system by email, direct-messaging, phone, and in-person points of contact.

This will be accomplished with discord, a dedicated email/phone number, and automated ticketing software.  

# Hardware Security

The miner will use the ECC608 Crypto Authorization Cell chip to increase swarm key security.

# Manufacturing Information

The Layer 3 Tech team and advisors have years of combined experience manufacturing Bitcoin ATMs, IoT devices, and providing customer support services.

Our 3D printers & injection molds allow for the on-site creation in the USA of the outer casings needed to present the hardware in a clean and professional manner. When and where available to combat the current supply chain crunch and to compress timeframes currently plaguing the Helium miner ecosystem, our company will source components through our United States based manufacturing partners. These established suppliers and manufacturers have modernized production capabilities in our local ecosystem, responsibly producing and assembling devices by U.S. companies in an environmentally friendly manner.


# Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately.

  

# Budget & Capital

Our team has investors and advisors necessary to meet the growing demand for Helium miners. We have the capacity to produce up to 5,000 units per month in 10-12 weeks time (considering approval will take more than a few weeks). Given confirmation from the Helium team we will allocate a large budget to meet current demand accordingly which we will distribute to our manufacturing partners in Texas, North Carolina, and California.

# Risks & Challenges

The key risks and challenges we identified are the availability of the electronic components and chips necessary to produce the Helium miner as well as the COVID-19 Pandemic reeking havoc on our supply chain. We will secure and stock the components needed in case of supply line disturbances. Considering the growing demand for these devices we understand the need to scale production and already have R&D structures in place.

# Other Information  
  

Overnight Shipping will be available at a premium and our partners will produce units as needed and scale as necessary based on demand. We seek to grow and expand the Helium ecosystem through a robust supply chain, rapid prototyping and sustainable production. Our team seeks to work closely with the community to provide clarity to our practices and real time updates in production using a modern web portal. Our goal is to produce quality products that are both upgradable via a viable software platform and modifiable via a robust IOT hardware platform such as the raspberry pi.
