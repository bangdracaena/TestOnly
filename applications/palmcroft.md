## Customer Support System
We will be responding to customer support requests via email, live chat services, our company website,
and discord. There will be multiple avenues for the consumer to get support questions answered directly
from us or directly from other consumers via discord. We will provide clear information on our website
about made-on-demand systems and how they work. Once an order is placed, a bi-weekly update will be
sent to the client informing them of how quickly we are moving on getting their product to them.

## Hotspot Fleet Management
We will be utilizing our in-house fleet management software: PalmConnect, to send updates and rollbacks with this system. The Palm Dashboard will have the ability to manage each hotspot from the cloud.

## Hardware Security
Our system contains an ECC608A security-chip for key-storage. This system has been tested and has the
highest levels of security on the market. It will be integrated onto our custom Pi Hat.

## Manufacturing Information
The Palm Hotspot will have items designed using a custom Pi hat and custom LoRa concentrator. We will have both of these components built into one chip;
the hat. Our PCB design team is working closely with MJS Design Inc. in Tempe, AZ to create these items. MJS Design Inc. is a trusted name in PCB design and Manufacturing and has experience in creating LoRa Gateways from the ground up. We plan to have 2,000 units ready for shipment by mid to late Q1 2022.

## Budget and Capital
Palmcroft industries has ample capital to bring 10,000 units to our future customers by Q1 2022. However, due to the worldwide chip shortage we feel more confident promising 2,000 units to market for batch one.

## Risks and Challenges
- By using custom chips and technology we circumvent the issues around shortage of supplies in
the supply chain but raw material prices will affect us more greatly.
- Because the technology being used to support this network is well known and often used for other
purposes it was a challenge to communicate with our designers about exactly what we needed,
once we hurdled this it has been smooth sailing.
