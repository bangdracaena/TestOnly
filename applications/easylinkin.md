## Customer Support ##

EasyLinkin can provide customer support via:

* Discord’s Vendor channel
* 7 * 24 hours customer enquiry
* FAQ section for customer to search the answers of their issues.
* The hardware maintenance service will be one year free for labor cost, provided hardware replacement if the breakdown of hardware comes from itself.
* The software issues could be solved by SSH remote access or OTA upgrade.

## Hardware Security ##

Our gateway has an **RJGT102WDP8** encryption chip which is originally used for intellectual property protection.

* It integrates 176-byte EEPROM, 128-byte registers, 8-byte key, 8-byte user-id/serial number and 16-byte control information.
* It uses the SHA-256 Encryption-Authentication Algorithm, supports configurable watchdog timer, outputs reset control signals, and can also communicate with MCU through I²C serial interface. 
* It also supports the low-power mode. 

RJGT102WDP8 is very secure as it has a high-performance integrated circuit used for copy protection. It adopts the SHA-256 encryption algorithm and has disposable programmable units. On top of that, the registers allow writing user-customized EEPROM units. It is pin-to-pin with ECC508A and can be used to store the swarm keys issued by Helium.

The sharing of prototype for adult result could be further discussed and arranged.

## Manufacturing Information ##

We have long-standing business cooperation with a number of trusted manufacturing partners and have successfully delivered multiple major projects in the past 5 years including Alibaba LoRaWAN City Coverage for Hangzhou, 300Ku LoRaWAN Water Meter projects in China and 30Ku LoRaWAN Electricity Meter Projects for Indonesia. We will continue using these manufacturers for producing Helium Hotspot Miner and Helium Light Gateway.

## Proof of Identity

Separately submitted to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

Based on the current estimate and market insight, Easylinkin intends to produce 20Ku per month in 2021 and allows production flexibility as customer demand requires.

Due to the necessity of components readiness for manufacturing gateway products, EasyLinkin should balance cash flow and reserve a minimum US$1M as the budget for supply chain. 

## Risks & Challenges

Since our factories are all in mainland China, there may be possible delay in transportation and maintenance of our products. We are planning to establish cooperation with international courier service should the proposal goes well.

Another thing to concern is the scale of our customer service with the growth of the network. More resource will be deployed.
