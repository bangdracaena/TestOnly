# Chengdu Heltec Automation Technology Co., Ltd.
### Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per [HIP19](https://github.com/helium/HIP/blob/master/0019-third-party-manufacturers.md)

## Summary

The Heltec Automation is an all-in-one IoT solutions provider and manufacturer mainly based on LoRa/LoRaWAN. We provide systemized products line ranging from LoRa end nodes, LoRaWAN gateways, to LoRa cloud servers. Our aim is that all users can get a complete solution using any of our products.

It would be greatly appreciated that if two of our tailored regular Hotspots can be in the Helium family. One is "Heltec Indoor Hotspot", it's an exclusively designed product for the Helium network. The other one is "Heltec Outdoor Hotspot", this hotspot is an upgrade version of our current [HT-M02 Edge LoRa Gateway](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m02/). And a Light Hotspot based on [HT-M01S Indoor Gateway](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m01s/) is at the development stage.

## Company Information

Founded in 2014, We started to develop and sell LoRa/LoRaWAN products from Q3 2017. With extensive experience in developing LoRa devices and relevant cloud computing, In 2019, we made the Arduino and its relevant toolchain migration for ASR650X series SiP. This is the first time that PSoC series MCU can run Arduino perfectly (We call it [CubeCell Series](https://heltec.org/cubecell_overview/)). Our products are used by partners all over the world,  even can see our products in the remote Antarctica (Scott Base).

We have our own SMT processing factory. Therefore, the R&D, production, and testing process are all conducted by ourselves,  this enables us to have rigid control of producing process and product quality.

In our opinion, the Helium blockchain provides a decentralized public network that interacts with the blockchain. Everyone is a contributor to this network and benefits from it. This will be of great help with the large-scale deployment of LongFi/LoRaWAN networks, makes the Internet of Everything possible in the near future. This is the reason why we want to be one of the officially approved hotspot manufacturers.

## Product Information

The following are our current LoRa related products:

- Heltec LoRa Gateway series: [Heltec Gateway Series](https://heltec.org/proudct_center/lora/lora-gateway/)
- Heltec LoRa Node series: [Heltec LoRa End Node List](https://docs.heltec.cn/#/en/products/lora/lora_node/heltec_lora_node_list)

In the process of R&D and production of LoRa products, we have accumulated a wealth of experience in product design, structural design, and manufacturing. In our design concept, market-oriented products come first. The "market-oriented" here shouldn't just be what users need, but it is decided by many factors like whether the upstream supply chain can meet the production needs or not, whether the chips, components, etc. required by the product have a sufficient life cycle or can they still be bought in the market?

### Heltec Outdoor Hotspot

![](heltec/06.png)

The "Heltec Outdoor Hotspot" is an upgrade version based on [Heltec HT-M02 Edge LoRa Gateway](https://heltec.org/project/ht-m02/). This gateway already sold ~2000 sets since Q3 2019. It has an all-aluminum shell and a special heat dissipation structure (this structure has obtained a Chinese patent). But judging from our daily work and user feedback, this product has the following problems:

1. The internal structure is complicated, resulting in low assembly efficiency;
2. In harsh environments, the waterproof performance is not good enough, such as in the seaside of Indonesia, the continuous tropical high temperature and the humid, high-salt air, after a period of operation, the waterproof performance becomes very poor.

We will improve the above issues in this upgrade. In addition to the circuit upgrade, mainly improve the protective structure and strengthen lightning protection measures. The upgrade process already began and will end in August 2021. Mass production will begin in September. Monthly produce is expected to be 3000-5000 sets.

**Estimated price:** 469 USD

## Hardware Security

All the miner variants feature a secure element, powered by ATECC608B from Microchip. And the key data to be secured (`swarm keys`, `API tokens`, etc) are kept in a separate partition which is encrypted and secured by using the secure element. In order to deal with the possible tension of the ECC608 chip, we reserve an alternative based on RJGT102WDP8 / RJGT102WDT6.

In addition to that, before the firmware upgrade process will perform the hardware and copyright verification process first. We are very experienced in this area. Beginning in 2020, every product we produce has a serial number binding, which is used to verify authenticity, and unlock software permissions, obtain corresponding technical information and support.

## Manufacturing Information

We sell more than 300,000 sets of LoRa devices each year, including LoRa gateways, LoRa end nodes, LoRa development boards and LoRa modules. And this data is constantly growing. All the products are produced in our self's SMT factory. Maximum to 600,000 components can be assembled every day. Therefore, while producing our own products, we also provide PCBA services to our customers. In this process, we have reached a good and stable cooperative relationship with many suppliers, which can ensure the stable supply of various devices.

If we have fortunate to become an approved hotspot manufacturer, we will stop provide PCBA services public. Our factory will fully produce, test, assemble hotspots and other products of Heltec. 

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted in private.

## Budget & Capital

We have enough funds available to produce large volumes. This money is independent of our daily working capital. 

## Risks & Challenges

From the perspective of Q3 2020, the shortage of chips globally become a barrier for most hardware manufacturers.

Through comprehensive assessment, we identified that the biggest challenge is since Q3 of 2020, the worldwide shortage of chips and electronic components, also the lead time cannot be guaranteed. I believe this is also a barrier for most hardware manufacturers.

As our accumulated experience in the area, when designing the products, we deliberately avoided devices that are very public. And we have a certain amount component in inventory to deal with the initial production.
