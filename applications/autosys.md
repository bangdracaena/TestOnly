## Product Information

Your time to shine! What are you building? Whatâ€™s so great about it? Do you have an approximate price point? Photos and videos welcome.

* Detailed hardware designs, including relevant parts
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - photos, videos. Renderings are OK but physical prototypes are much, much better.
* Your plan for software setup and configuration for the devices. This would presumably include remote updates and the ability for hosts to change wifi settings, via Helium's official app or otherwise.
* What is your expected production and delivery timeline?

## Customer Support

Yes we will setup a customer support for our products. For any manufacturing defects, the devices will be replaced to the user, however for any repairs they will have to be shipped back to us.

How are you planning to handle customer support for your products? For how long? How are you planning to handle repairs and replacements?

## Hardware Security

The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their `swarm_key` files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail)

## Manufacturing Information
Yes we have built the Quad IOT devices in the past, we have used multiple forms of variants for the same. We have built with Raspberry Pi, Arduino Board and custom Snapdragon processor as well. We have setup a manufacturing infrastructure, where our inhouse team shall design the circuits, the PCB is manufactured in Gujarat, India, Components are procured from Bangalore,India and Taiwan and soldered at Mumbai, India. The final fabrication is made at Haryana, India and assembled finally there. We have a Quality team setup there which will further inspect and dispatch.

## Proof of Identity

Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments. Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub.

## Budget & Capital

We are planning to start with 100,000 devices in the first 12 months and based on sales we can ramp up our capacity to serve upto 500,000 a year. We would require $300,000 USD to start. We have $200,000 USD on hand and we have access to $5,000,000 USD credit line which can be extended to $25,000,000 on proving sales and purchase orders. If we require additional financing we have collaborations with banks and manufacturing partners who would be interested in investing.

## Risks & Challenges

The challenges we forsee are as followings : 

Governemnt Regulations imposed :
We plan to combat the above concerns effectively by collaborating with the industrial ministry for aggregating the same as a part of digital initiatives kickstarted by the government. 
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality, and how you might address them.
