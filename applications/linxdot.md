Application to become an approved third party manufacturer as per HIP19

## Summary
Linxdot is a device manufacturer for IoT and a supporter of The People’s Network. We are part of the same business structure as Livermorium and Fx Technology, a UK based smartphone & accessory manufacturer. We develop technology products that bring new and enhanced functionality to our day-to-day lives. Our team has strong experience in electronic designs, telecommunications and creating end consumer devices. We always strive to create high-quality products, provide high levels of customer support and most importantly we like working with the community to bring user-led innovations to market. Our plan is to first of all create a Helium miner - Linxdot Indoor to support the growth of the Helium network. We’ll make these available globally and use our existing sales and distribution channels.

## Company Information
Linxdot is part of the Livermorium & Fx Technology, London UK group of companies. Started in 2017, our mission has been to create purposeful products that refine functionality leading to an enhanced user experience. Our products consist of our own designed and manufactured consumer devices, with our core focus being Qualcomm based high-spec Android smartphones and accessories. With customers in over 60 countries and a strong community of users, we really support the approach of collaborating with the Community and for the Community. Across the business, we have existing engineering, supply chain, and customer support teams already in place to support the Linxdot miner.

We have a consumer smartphone brand that is supported by a  community of users (whose support we appreciate a lot). For Helium we understand the importance of community and would like to help grow the People’s Network through collaboration and take a more consumer-focused approach, by getting the Linxdot hotspot (and potentially other products) out to as many people as we can globally.

Our products have been sold through various different online and offline channels, including directly from our own online stores and through a number of online resellers in UK, EU, Japan, and Hong Kong. We’ve also sold our products physically in stores in London, Berlin, and Tokyo.

Our team has a shared passion for connecting people and things together from across the world, through uniqueness and innovative approaches to solving problems. As well as expertise in engineering and consumer products, some of our team have experience of distributed computing research and IOT/MVNO network build-outs for European telcos, so we are keen to help build out the Helium IOT network and also the devices that will use it.

## Product Information 
The Linxdot Helium Miner is a product of Fx Technology and Livermorium’s smartphone manufacturing expertise. Our goal is to popularise further the idea of building the Helium network through our extensive experience developing, manufacturing, and delivering consumer mobile devices. The Linxdot miner is a consumer-oriented device beautifully designed to complement your living room while featuring performant, reliable, and secure internal hardware and software.

## Customer Support
Our in-house customer service and support team will provide international pre-sales support and after-sales support predominantly via email. This will include ongoing customer questions, queries, handling repair requests, and the replacement of miners for manufacturing defects or faulty units. We will aim to respond to all emails within 24-48 hours. 

We will also be accessible via Discord, Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and Instagram.

## Hardware Security 
The Linxdot Miner is built through our comprehensive experience in creating mobile devices compliant with banking applications, storing sensitive user data, and providing enterprise support. Our Helium hotspot adopts the same security standards applied to hardware, software, and user systems.

A secure ECC chip has been integrated for storing the swarm-key used by the miner as per the requirements. The device supports OTA updates.
 
## Manufacturing Information

We have designed, manufactured our own products (smartphones and accessories), we are familiar with the challenges. The engineering team has expertise in electronics design, hardware and manufacturing on a large scale and of consumer / retail quality.  Our manufacturing partner (Eternity HK) is based in Shenzhen and also plays an advisory role to our business. We have a close working relationship with them which helps to get our manufacturing prioritised and delivery on time. For example, we’ve done FCC/CE approvals on our products, we have rigorous testing procedures and quality control measures to ensure that devices which roll off the production line are all to the highest standard. Our return rate on products due to manufacturing issues is so far less than less than 0.5%.

The biggest challenge for Linxdot miner will be supply of components as this is out of our direct control, the other aspects of design, test, manufacture we control along with our manufacturing partner. We have faced similar challenges in the past and so we’ve already spoken to our manufacturing partner about this. To mitigate this risk, we have already spoken to suppliers in China and are in the process of pre-ordering the components required for our first batch (estimated 5,000).  

## Proof of Identity
Submitted privately to the DeWi.
Linxdot is a product of FX Technology Limited. UK company number: 11602958.
 
## Budget & Capital
As an existing UK technology hardware business, we have sufficient funds to manufacture the first large batch of these up front and will manage our cashflow appropriately to continue to manufacture for the coming years. 
If orders scale much larger than forecasted, we have favourable finance terms with our manufacturing partner as they are a HK stock exchange listed business who will fund part of the cost for us. Another option available to us is the use of other finance solutions (UK trade or inventory finance solutions which we have used in the past as interim finance measures). 
 
## Risks & Challenges 
Shipping and distribution can be tricky, our main distribution partner (BrandPath, a global business) we’ve used for the past 18 months and they are extremely reliable and have fast turnaround times. Their HK office liaises with our factory in China when it comes closer to shipping. Within a few days our products are collected to HK, then typically within 48 hrs are shipped onwards to our warehouses or directly to end customers. They also ship smartphones and accessories for other major global technology brands (they are pretty big so we are not allowed to name them!). We also have smaller distributors based in US, Germany, UK and Japan who will approach to resell Linxdot and help to get it out to customers in these parts of the world and help to build the People’s Network!
