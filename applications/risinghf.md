Besides gateways, RisingHF can also provide a series of end-node modules, and sensor products. Our current product list can be found here http://www.risinghf.com/product in our website.

## Customer Support

Customer support will be mainly handled via email. Discord will be also supported, too. Support will be provided for lifetime of the product.

Repairs/Replacements will be handled globally, we will control design, supply chain, manufacture strictly to low down the possible cost and decrease the risk.

## Hardware Security

We will adapt ECC608 or similar chips to provide following encryption features:

* Encrypted/locked-down firmware
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures like an ECC chip
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures.

Samples can be provided to DeWi and/or Helium and be submitted to any tests.

## Manufacturing Information

We have years of experience to build LoRa® products, and have delivered millions of devices to our customer globally. We rely on contract manufactures to produce our product.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

RisingHF and our strategic partner BYD have signed a cooperation agreement for Helium hotspot / gateway manufacturing to ensure the stable production and supply of products. We have invested enough funds to produce more than 10,000 units per month. If necessary, we will re-plan the quantity to meet market demand.

## Risks & Challenges

The biggest challenge that we see now is the production of SX130x. Several core components are difficult to buy currently. But with our strong supply team and safe inventory, we think we can provide the gateways smoothly.
