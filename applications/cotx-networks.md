## Customer Support

We will handle the after-sales issues by Email or online upgrades during the lifetime of products. This model will have online upgrade and maintaining dashboard from web, it also supports OTA and APP BLE configuration.

About repairs and replacements within warranty period of 2years:

l If the device is defective due to our manufacturing process or shipping/mishandling on our part we will immediately ship a new replacement out free of charge.

l If the device/one of modules is defective due to user mishandling/error we will provide repair or ship-out a replacement part for a price. This includes case, raspberry pi, motherboard, power supply, antenna. 

## Hardware Security

Currently we are planning the following:

· Our X3 Miner gateways will store their swarm_key on an ECC chip as requested. As well as providing some security this should mean if the operating system becomes corrupted that the user can recover their miner with ease.
· We will be more than happy to submit prototypes for audit. For future products we are evaluating more options including other security element chips.

## Manufacturing Information

Cotx Networks invested significantly in R&D and launches numerous of gateways each year for various projects such as applications of smart street, smart computer room, national museum, smart greenhouse, which contain hardware of LoRaWAN indoor gateway, outdoor gateway, AIOT edge gateway, integrated gateway etc. We are the main hardware&platform supplier of TOPSEC, SHUZHI.AI, TST, most of which are well known brands in China. What is more, as an OEM/ODM manufacturer, we have already produced over 50,000 sets LoRa trackers to Petfon with high quality.

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted privately to DeWi.

## Budget & Capital

We aim to produce 5000-10000pcs X3 Miner hotspots as our first batch, then steadily provide 10000 units by each month. Cotx have sufficient funds to produce large volumes, we have strong investment partner that could provide enough support, but not normally needed.

## Risks & Challenges

The greatest challenge in our opinion is that the supply chain of SX1301 with price volatility currently, but we could handle it by a rich running stock, extra 10000 pieces chipsets or even more will be there for stable materials supply.
